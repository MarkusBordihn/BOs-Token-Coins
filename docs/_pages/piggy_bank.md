### How to put coins in the piggy bank ?

Take any kind of [Coin](../coins/) in your hand and click on the placed piggy bank block.
The coin will be automatically transferred to your piggy bank.

click at the same time.

Click with your empty hand on the piggy bank and it will tell you the amount which is currently
in your piggy bank.

Just like a normal piggy bank, destroy you piggy bank and it will drop all of your collected coins.
Note: The piggy bank itself will not be dropped and is just destroyed.

## Effects

Piggy banks has special effects which could be activated with specific items.
For example give a carrot to the pig piggy bank and see whats happen.
Keep in mind that not all effects are positive, so you should not use flint and stone on the TNT piggy bank.

Note: The effects could be deactivated over the configuration file.

The piggy bank is limited internally to about 27 slots and tries to intelligent sort and stack the
given coins.
If the limit is reached you will get a message that your piggy bank is full.
